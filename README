Sets up a reverse tunnel to a trusted middle server
So that someone can ssh into a endpoint without knowing the
end IP or if the endpoint is behind a firewall
(kindof same concept as logmein type service)

Forwards SERVER:2222 => USER:22

Notes:
   Server must have "GatewayPorts yes" options. This allows the forward to
   listen externally
   Otherwise ssh -oProxyCommand="SERVER nc %h %p" localhost -p 2222 will suffice
   sshd must be running on the endpoint (obviously)
   Finally, Port 2222 must be not firewalled by the remote server as well.

Future Plans:
   Adding a desktop file so that it can just be clicked to run in the background
      or a dumb window since the purpose is to allow me to have on demand access 
      to a computer for technical support when necessary.
